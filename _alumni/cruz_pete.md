I came to UCSB as a Pre-Medical student and switched to Computer Science. At UCSB, I was fortunate to meet a group of friends who were dedicated to bettering themselves as both a computer scientist and engineer. I was exposed to many schools of thought, domains including programming languages, security, databases, and web dev. I found that to be one of the unique factors in helping me grow.

After graduation, I worked at [Invoca](https://www.invoca.com/) in Santa Barbara, until moving to San Francisco beginning of 2015 to work at a YC startup. With a small team and fast paced environment, I had the opportunity to create software for dealing with big data and distributed systems and handling automation and ops. In 2016, I joined another startup which was recently acquired by [Caterpillar](caterpillar).

I will be delivering software to enable a real time bidding platform for fleet rentals. [Caterpillar](caterpillar) is an international company as well and so I will have the opportunity to deal with large scale, complex problems while learning more about both domestic and international construction.
